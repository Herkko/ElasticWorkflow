      	<h2>Implementation tool for directly editable enterprise architectures: an
		elastic workflow engine for the cloud</h2>

		<h3>Asiakas</h3>

		<h3>Työn kuvaus</h3>

		<p>Many organizations use enterprise architecture as a tool for defining their
		operations. Business process charts are used to model the workflow of the
		organization's services and operations. Originated in the area of large
		business information management, the idea of enterprise architecture is now
		being mandated in organizations of various sizes. For example, in Finland,
		many public organizations are required to model their enterprise
		architecture by the law [1]. </p>

		<p>Currently, many tools exist for modeling an organization's enterprise
		architecture. Many of these tools are notoriously from the pre-web era:
		they are used as desktop applications, in which an enterprise architect
		treats the modeling artifacts on her own hard drive; and the results are to
		be included in the printed documentation binder. When the modeling is
		completed, the set of documentation is given out to an implementation team
		as the requirements document. This is a rigid, inflexible way of working;
		current process researchers would classify this as a waterfall process
		model. </p>

		<p>Small and medium size businesses and governmental organizations need more
		flexible tools for implementing their architecture. Organization having too
		rigid application development cycle leads to development of shadow
		applications within the organization [2]. This is a productivity losing
		situation, as different departments reinvent their own versions of the
		enterprise's applications, using their own view of the organization's
		functions. </p>
		
		<p>Modern web technologies allow the use of direct edibility of modeling
		artifacts. For example, web-based interface builders can be utilized to
		build web sites directly: see [3] for a demo. With the term direct
		editability we refer to the possibility to perform live updates to a
		running system, and being able to see the effects of the modification
		instantly. This leads to reduced edit/deploy/test cycle times, since
		updates can be done at runtime.</p>
		
		<p>The final aspect in this project is the elasticity of workflows.
		Traditionally, cloud-based elasticity refers to the application performance
		scalability in the cloud environment, since it is possible to up- and
		downscale the number of servers allocated to a given application. Also
		processes can be elastic in terms of resource consumption and quality of
		service [4]. </p>
		
		<p>In this project, we build a prototype of a tool for implementing
		applications for a given enterprise architecture. The tool utilizes
		directly editable workflows and allows the definition of workflow data
		models at runtime. This project is done in collaboration with the National
		Institute for Health and Welfare [5]. </p>
